1. What was the bug?
    - The bug was that num1 and num2 are strings, so the result ends up as the concatenations of the num1 and num2 rather than the sum.

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)
    - Using the function Number(), convert the strings num1 and num2 when calculating the result.
